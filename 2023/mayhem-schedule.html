But more and more red team targets require intercepting and tampering with machine-to-machine communication.  This talk will will show some of the lesser known tools and techniques provided by the Linux kernel networking stack to build your own tools to perform man-in-the-middle against targets in a network.  I will provide an introduction to Man-in-the-Middle using Linux as a router or a bridge.  It covers topics such as isolating the MiTM/Attacker machine, using Linux as a “one-armed” router, and using Linux as a passthrough router with demos:</p><p>- Intercepting DNS&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">- Intercepting HTTPS&nbsp;</span></p><p>- Intercepting SSH</p><p>Finally, in those cases where you can't mess with routing, we will be using Linux as a MiTM bridge that works at layer 2, but yet intercepts and forwards traffic to other machines for processing.</p><p>---------------------</p><p><strong>Red Teaming DevOps</strong></p><p>Speakers: <a href="https://twitter.com/d1vious" target="_blank">Jose Hernandez</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/rodsoto" target="_blank">Rod Soto</a></p><p>Abstract: A set of practices in software development and information technology known as DevOps has become the leading reference for software development and IT operations that aim to provide continuous integration, delivery and software quality assurance. These practices have brought many advantages such as rapid development and delivery of software and system platforms, along with integration with cloud platforms. These new advantages come with a price and that price is the augmentation of attack surface. This presentation shows the different attack vectors in the CI/CD Devops attack surface broken down by components and implications for those enterprises using Devops practices. Specific attack tools along with methodology will be provided to showcase with proof of concepts how to apply read team methodology against Devops practices.&nbsp;</p><p>---------------------</p><p><strong>Red Team Built-in Scenario Place</strong></p><p>Speakers: <a href="https://twitter.com/ggsec_" target="_blank">Gokberk Gulgun</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erdeneru/" target="_blank">Erdener Uyan</a></p><p>Red Team activities are undoubtedly one of the fastest developing solutions against the cyber attacks of today. In this talk, we'll take a look at our work on an open-source proactive machine learning powered automation tool that performs red team simulations. This automation tool provides the opportunity to try out all available attack scenarios, thereby helping the community, especially organizations, to develop mechanisms to protect against these attacks before attackers do. Currently, red, blue and purple teams are improving day by day with the contributions made by open source. We will demonstrate the scenario playbook developed to collect the scenarios prepared for the red, blue and purple team on a single scenario place. The aim of this playbook is to protect the systems from such attack vectors, to examine the attack scenarios, to protect their systems by viewing the protection mechanisms and to contribute to these scenarios. With the built-in Scenario Place, people can either run these scenarios or check the scenario configurations on their systems. All scenario titles are prepared in accordance with MITRE and Cyber Kill Chain.</p><p>All scenarios from various teams such as Atomic Red Team, Mitre and TIBER-EU are fed into the application as input. The target distribution of those scenarios has been found out to be 60% Windows, 19% Linux and 21% MacOS, which is an uneven distribution. Balancing this distribution with the support of people in the open source community can be achieved with a project like this. Our side aim is to gather and develop the attack scenarios not only for the endpoints but also for the network.Protection mechanisms will be developed on the network side with the malicious traffic and applications enriching scenarios. When commercial red team applications are examined, it is seen that they cover at most 2000 scenarios. With this built-in component, relevant open source repositories and other red-team sources that can create scenarios will be scanned and analyzed to reach a much larger number of scenarios. These scenarios would then be available to be used for a threat hunting service. Thus, this project will both contribute to the public community and help people improve their security posture.</p><p>----------------------</p><p><strong>Abaddon, the Red Team Angel</strong></p><p>Speaker: <a href="https://twitter.com/Ibrahimous" target="_blank">Charles Ibrahim</a></p><p>Abstract: Red team operations involve miscellaneous skills, last several months and are politically sensitive; they require a lot of monitoring, consolidating and caution. Wavestone’s red team operations management software, Abaddon, has been designed to make red team operations faster, more repeatable, stealthier, while including value-added tools and bringing numerous reporting capabilities.</p><p>--------------------------</p><p><strong>Adversary Emulation and the C2 Matrix</strong></p><p>Speaker: <a href="https://twitter.com/jorgeorchilles" target="_blank">Jorge Orchilles&nbsp;</a></p><p>Abstract: Adversary Emulation is a type of Red Team Exercise where the Red Team emulates how an adversary operates, following the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with a specific objective (similar to those of realistic threats or adversaries). Adversary emulations are performed using a structured approach, which can be based on a kill chain or attack flow. Methodologies and Frameworks for Adversary Emulations will be covered shortly.&nbsp;</p><p>Adversary emulation Red Team Exercises emulate an end-to-end attack against a target organization to obtain a holistic view of the organization’s preparedness for a real, sophisticated attack. This will be the main focus of SANS SEC564 Red Team Exercises and Adversary Emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Command and Control is one of the most important tactics in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix as it allows the attacker to interact with the target system and realize their objectives. Organizations leverage Cyber Threat Intelligence to understand their threat model and adversaries that have the intent, opportunity, and capability to attack. Red Team, Blue Team, and virtual Purple Teams work together to understand the adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures to perform adversary emulations and improve detective and preventive controls.&nbsp;</p><p>The C2 Matrix was created to aggregate all the Command and Control frameworks publicly available (open-source and commercial) in a single resource to assist teams in testing their own controls through adversary emulations (Red Team or Purple Team Exercises). Phase 1 lists all the Command and Control features such as the coding language used, channels (HTTP, TCP, DNS, SMB, etc.), agents, key exchange, and other operational security features and capabilities. This allows more efficient decisions making when called upon to emulate and adversary TTPs.</p><p>It is the golden age of Command and Control (C2) frameworks. Learn how these C2 frameworks work and start testing against your organization to improve detective and preventive controls.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">- Learn how Red Teams and Blue Teams work together in virtual Purple Teams</span><br></p><p>- Leverage Cyber Threat Intelligence to understand adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures</p><p>- Perform adversary emulations in Red or Purple Team Exercises</p><p>- Choose which command and control to use for the assessment to provide the most value</p><p>- Measure and improve people, process, and technology</p><p>-----------</p><p><strong>The Pentester Blueprint: A Guide to Becoming a Pentester</strong></p><p>Speaker: <a href="https://twitter.com/PhillipWylie" target="_blank">Phillip Wylie</a></p><p>Abstract: Pentesting or ethical hacking as it is more commonly known has become a much sought-after job by people in IT, InfoSec, or those just trying to get into the industry. In this presentation, Phillip Wylie shares the blueprint for becoming a pentester. The presentation combines Phillip’s experience as a pentester and ethical hacking instructor to give attendees a guide on how to pursue a career as a pentester. Phillip shares what has worked for his students and people that he has mentored over his years as a pentester. This presentation covers the knowledge and skills needed to become a pentester as well as the steps to achieve them.</p><p>------------</p><p><strong>Maintaining Infrastructure as a Red Teamer - RedTeamOps</strong></p><p>Speaker: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcoskuner" target="_blank">Mert Can Coskuner</a></p><p>Abstract: Red team operations involve many skills, the operation requires a lot of monitoring, consolidating and caution. In order to perform red team operations faster, and stealthier without thinking about the infrastructure every team has its' own habits and standarts. However, there is a problem with those habits and standarts; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>- There are tons of tools but no operation management,</p><p>- No aggregation between these tools,</p><p>- When OPSEC fails due to problems above or any other reason, it’s essential to possess the capability of maintaining robust infrastructure which can be recreated if discovered, and more importantly, without any issues upon deployment.</p><p>In this talk, infrastructure challenges we face as a red teamer will be discussed. Along with challenges, a solution will be proposed based on DevOps practices such as;</p><p>- Design your infrastructure based on the standarts and habits which your team has</p><p>- Create playbooks which suits your needs based on your design</p><p>- Create CI pipeline to test and maintain your playbooks</p><p>--------------</p><p><strong>A Journey Through Adversary Emulation</strong></p><p>Speaker: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasbauters/" target="_blank">Jonas Bauters</a></p><p>Abstract: During this talk, Jonas will take you on a journey through adversary emulation, from its inception to its adoption and application. They will show you how they integrated adversary emulation into their red teaming approach using MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK framework. Next to the more classic red teaming assessments, other adversary emulation flavors, such as purple teaming and integration with the TIBER framework will be covered as well. To top things off, we’ll have a look at the differences between emulation and simulation. After this talk, you will have a structured overview of everything adversary emulation &amp; simulation.</p><p><br></p></div>
